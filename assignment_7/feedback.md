Dear F,

Your presentation is well done and provides a great overview of YouTube and the opportunities for language learning and
is well done.

You highlight the opportunity that YouTube offers with users generating content, such as access to native speaker
content, lessons, and the ability to tailor YouTube for kids and teenagers. Additionally, you give a good overview of
the subscription mode that exists on YouTube and highlight the functions that YouTube provides.

When it comes to teaching, you emphasize the potential that such a media corpus has for language learning. It can be
used to teach languages to pupils, but it requires guidance from the teacher.

I appreciate your critique of YouTube. You've pointed out problems that exist on the platform. But my wish would be a
bit more details in this point.  YouTube employs a moderate amount of so-called dark patterns to keep users engaged on
the platform [1]. It would be helpful if you could provide a short example, such as the "next video" function.
Furthermore, you could mention the issues in the past regarding the recommendation algorithm [2].

I've included two papers related to user interface research. The first paper discusses what dark patterns are and how
they are integrated on YouTube and Facebook. The second paper is on the consequences of these recommendations
and "the rabbit hole."

Nice work,
Andreas
