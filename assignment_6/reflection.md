# Reflection on Digital Storytelling (DTS)

My experience with the DTS exercise is quite mixed. I did notice that when I wrote the 
script for my story, I started to reflect on several things that have meaning to me and
what I wanted to share with the group in the seminar. I ended up with a random thought 
about my first real programming lesson. As I remembered the details of this particular 
lesson, I found interest in that simple program. With that, I wondered and wanted to 
learn more about the topic. While writing the script, I paid attention to my language
and put some effort into good-sounding English. English is not my mother tongue, but I 
want to express my thoughts in an adequate fashion. Therefore, I looked up some synonyms
and spent more time on the text itself. My experience was mixed regarding the search 
for fitting visual content. I simply don't enjoy that kind of search. Compared to the 
text, I spent way less time on it. For the recording, I paid more attention to my 
pronunciation than I do normally in a conversation.

I believe the finished product is alright for the amount of effort that I put into it. 
I could use more time on the visualization, but I simply did not enjoy this and went 
for the "good enough" version. But I like the experience of writing and recording my voice.

If I analyze my experience with the exercise, I can see that I gained a more in-depth 
understanding of the history of programming education. I also had the opportunity to 
express myself creatively with language, which I did enjoy. Moreover, I could express 
myself in a visual way, which I enjoy a bit less. Also, I had the opportunity to learn 
a bit more about markdown. Sadik found in an experiment in 2008 that a more profound 
understanding, creative expression, and improved IT skills in students/pupils. Other 
findings related to collaborative learning are not applicable to my experience setting. 
But I can see that my experiences are in line with the findings from Sadik [1].

_If I think about the application of DST in Language Learning Classrooms, it is 
hard to put my role aside as a software engineer who is interested in learning 
technology. So I will take the liberty to argue from this perspective. Concerning 
the classroom, I will be speculating._

I think DST can be a valuable tool for the classroom. A system that facilitates a 
teacher and a group of learners should be based on the needs of these two user types. 
If we assume both groups are novices in media production and authoring, the tool should
provide a framework for both the pupils and the teacher. Breaking up the ideation and 
story writing (pre-production) and providing clear frames. The actual production can 
be supported with media artifacts that are safe to use (age-appropriate and copyright) 
and a browser application for editing. Depending on the age of the pupils, the teacher
should be able to select the artifacts, activate the editor, or ask the pupils to use a 
different tool. Together with an extension for a learning management system like Moodle,
such a system can support the use of DST in the classroom. Both the teacher and the 
pupil could be supported by this kind of tool, regardless of their prior knowledge in 
media production.

In a short search, I was unable to find such a plugin for Ilias or Moodle [2,3].
