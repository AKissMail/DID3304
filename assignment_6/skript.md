# Hello, World, and why is it a special sentence?
It doesn't matter where in the world you ask programming students
; they will all know the sentence "Hello, world." But why is this?
Well, it is probably the first example of a program that they will
program by themselves. Regardless of the programming language,
their level of experience, or their age, it is quite likely that 
they will learn this program first. So what does this program do?
It displays two words on the console: "Hello, world!"

As far as the internet knows, a programming textbook mentioned 
this first. In “The C Programming Language,” Brian Kernighan 
wrote the first example of Hello World:
```c
main( ) {
    printf("hello, world");
}
```
My first "Hello, world" was in 2019, in Lübeck, Germany. My programming
teacher had impressed me with their ability to talk and type at 
the same time. In this first lecture, we talked about Java, the 
programming language that we learned first. We talked about the 
data type string and that it is simply a sequence of characters. 
And then the moment came when she typed:
```java
class HelloWorldApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World");
    }
}
```
At that moment, I thought programming was a highly complex matter,
but now, if I look at it, it looks trivial in the basics. Sure, if
you're programming a really complex thing, it can get tricky from
time to time. Well, it gets tricky most of the time, and I remember
my struggles to get started. You have to think about so much, the
data types, programming patterns, keywords, and so much more. 
The frustration when a cryptic error message shows up or just 
freezes your computer. But somehow I understood more and more. 
Many enthusiastic students have mastered programming and are now 
building the digital world around us.
But most of them start with a small program, "Hello, World." 

This is the reason I think "Hello, world!" is a special sentence."
