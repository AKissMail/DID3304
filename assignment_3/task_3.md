Scope setting for this assignment
Since I am not a teaching student, Frederick offered me the possibility to reflect about a topic that I know from my studies. For my reflection, I chose a digital seminar in theoretical computer science (TCS). This seminar was forced to be digital due to the covid restriction in Germany. TCS is the subfield which includes computational theory or formal languages. An additional limitation is that I rely on my 

## Task 3: Professional digital competence - The transition of seminar in to the digital space.

Seminars are an interactive session where a teacher/expert meets with a group of people [1]. One of the main aspects of this format is, that the participant meat each other and discuss the mater of the Seminar together.  The Professional Digital Competence Framework for Teachers [2] (framework) lists 7 fields of competences. The one which is the most related to choose scenario, is the interaction and communication. To discuss this matter, I want to use an experience that I made some years ago during my first bachelor year. 


The Covid restrictions which took place in Germany forced the Teacher to change the Seminar format towards a digital format. Which binges the teacher in to the need to establish a new culture in the group of students. This includes three main aspects: The Teaching method, the Seminar activities and the examination of the students. 

He provided a script of another professor, which was handed to the students. The script itself was a PDF. The format of the Seminar was changed, the lecture part was emanated, and the students were asked to solve worksheets in small groups of 3 to 4 Students. More over that, the examination format was changed from a written exam to a hand in paper with a video presentation of the assigned topic. From the approach that we discussed in the Seminar, this can be seen as an adapted version of a flipped Classroom as it is described by Han & Røkenes [3].      

The adaptation requires from the Teacher and the Students the establishing of a new communication and collaboration culture. The teacher had at the beginning some minor shortcomings with this competence. He did not clarify the weekly task and assumed that the students will read the provided material on their own. In contrast to this, he was able to communicate the worksheets and to guide the discussion in each group. Due to the lack of communication, he had to spend a significant amount of time in the plenum, explaining the task. 

Based on the feedback of the Students, he adapted the teaching method and strengthened his skill of communication in a digital seminar. He published the scope of the lecture beforehand, together with his expatiation of the leaning outcome. He proved more appropriate material in the form of a Massive open online cures with interactive videos [4, 5]. The lecture time we spend in a more efficient matter. 

Together as a class, we were able to improve in different fields. The Teacher clearly improves his competence in facilitation of our leaning environment. This became clear in the facilitation of the group discussion and also in the adaption of the leaning material. Also, an improvement in the domain of leadership of the leaning process can be seen.
