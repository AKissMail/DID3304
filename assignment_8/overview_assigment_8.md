# Task 8 
## What AI tool(s) have you chosen, and why?
I have chosen the proper repository from Microsoft for education. The repository was made available three months ago and contains instructions for the Large Language Model (LLM) ChatGPT (so-called prompts). Currently, the repository contains prompts for educational sessions and tutoring. It is not specifically tailored to a subject.
## What are the opportunities and challenges with the AI tool in English and foreign language teaching (and beyond the classroom)?
With this set of prompts, we can support teachers in their daily work, especially when it comes to session preparation. Another big opportunity is the tutoring that can be provided with an LLM. As a challenge, hallucinations have to be named. This is the false statement that an LLM produces from time to time. Hallucinations have their reason in the design of an LLM and can be mitigated with a human-in-the-loop approach.   
A second challenge can be the misuse of LLM by students to produce essays or other assignments. This is an issue, especially in language classes, and I do not have an answer on how to mitigate it.  
## What are the opportunities, challenges, implications, and contributions of the AI tool for the English and foreign language teaching profession and PDC?
There, we can mention conversational agents. In earlier research, a significant effect was found in L2 learners when they practiced with systems like Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, or Apple Siri [1–5]. This study shows that conversation with this rather simple system are effective in decreasing the fear of searing an L2 learner and increasing their willingness to speak, confidence and ability to speak. If we take that further, it can be beneficial for oral and written communication skills. But this is an open research question.
## What could be a potential task design and learning outcomes (i.e., what are your students supposed to learn) for an English lesson/task where you implement the AI tool?
One example could be the use of an LLM as a tutor during a hard and complex assignment. The assignment is designed to be challenging for the students and requires additional reading beyond the classroom. To support the students, a prepared conversation with a LLM is provided, like the one in the provided example.    
In what ways can the AI tool be used with your students to meet the learning outcomes?
As ChatGPT is right now, we can use it for written communication. Students can practice formulating different dialogs, but it can also be used as a tutor to answer question.

## Where do you see this technology going in the next 5 years in the context of education?
I see the potential for LLM to be a disruptive technology that will provide possibilities in many fields, including teaching. One big application will be the production of educational content. These tools can support teachers in producing worksheets and other resources. This can solve the problem of copyrights in schools that open educational resources have tried to solve for the past few years. It can also support teachers in planning their lessons. This can free up resources that can be used to supplement teaching if allocated properly. In addition to this, labor-intensive tasks like 1-to-1 tutoring can be partially automated. An LLM can be the study tutor who is available 24/7 for the student to guide them through problem-based learning tasks or other assignments. Presently, we just see multiple purpura LLM systems, which are quite demanding in terms of computation resources during training and in operation. We will see more specialized models in the future, which will be more efficient.

But in general, we face exciting times. Now we can implement intelligent agents and develop new use cases that were not feasible three years ago. Now it is up to the fields of educational technology and didactics to develop their use cases and verify them for the classroom.
